# MusicTheoryQuiz


This is a demo project for testing different things . It's a music theory quiz to test key signature knowledge and music interval knowledge .

I was testing basic things like sending intent and opening new activity . Testing bitmap and drawing on canvas and testing different resolutions of different screens , tablet or phone . Also i designed basic UI and learned how to use different layouts and card view . There are few methods for overlaying images and resizing them because of different resolutions . Using matrices for basic transformations .
